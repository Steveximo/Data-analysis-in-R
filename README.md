# ABOUT THE PROJECT
  This project/repository contains part of the data set for my thesis project.It contains various variables(risk factors) attributed to blood pressure in adults.The records wer obtained from a database of a tertiary care hospital in India.
  
# PROBLEM:
  Worldwide, raised blood pressure is estimated to cause 7.5 million deaths, about(12.8%) of the total of all deaths per annum and the overall prevalence of blood pressure in 30 years+ was 32% in 2019.Raised blood pressure is a major risk factor for Coronary heart disease and stroke.
  
# GOAL OF THE PROJECT
  The project was intended to understand and analyse some of the risk factors of blood pressure using a sample size of 93 patients and make meaningful inferences for the entire hypertensive population.
  
 The tools used for exploration,manipulation and analysis included;
 (i)     ggplot2
 (ii)    dplyr
 (iii)   tidyverse
 (iv)    tidyr
 (v)     magrittr
 (vi)    Hmisc
 (vii)   Chisquare test
 (viii)  Student t test
 (ix)    Correlation and Regression analysis to fit the model
 
 The results showed that increase in age was more likely to lead to increased blood pressure followed by Body mass index(BMI) while gender, smoking status and family history background showed no association.
